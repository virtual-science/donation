Still in the same project folder, create and a file named ProcFile containing the following:

web: play run --http.port=$PORT $PLAY_OPTS
Next, we need to make one significant change to the app. Open the 'Users' model and adjust the the class as follows:

@Entity
@Table(name="`User`") //This is necessary because User is a reserved word in PostGreSQL
public class User extends Model
'User' is a reserved table name in the database, so we have altered the name slightly to avoid a conflict.

In Git Bash terminal cd into the folder containing your spacebook project, and create a git repository for the project:

git init
Add all files (except those matched by .gitignore) to the repo and commit them using these commands:

git add --all
git commit -m "first commit"
Verify that everything is ok by running this command

git status
